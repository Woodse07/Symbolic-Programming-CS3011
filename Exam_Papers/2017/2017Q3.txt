QUESTION 3.

(a)

nm --> zero(N), one(M), {M is N + N}.

zero(0) --> [].
zero(N) --> [0], zero(NN), {N is NN + 1}.

one(0) --> [].
one(M) --> [1], one(MM), {M is MM + 1}.


(b)

Difference lists represent the information about grammatical categories as the difference
between two lists. The first list is what should be consumed and the second is what should
be left behind. If sentece is accepted by the grammar, first list should be entirely 
consumed, and the second list should be the empty list.

**Not entirely sure but should be something like this..**
nm(A, C) :- zero(A, B, N), one(B, C, M), M is N + N.

zero(['0'|T], Ret, N) :- zero(T, Ret, NN), N is NN + 1.
zero(Ret, Ret, 0).

one(['1'|T], Ret, N) :- one(T, Ret, NN), N is NN + 1.
one(Ret, Ret, 0).
