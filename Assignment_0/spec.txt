Implement a program that provides the following operations on a binary tree.
insert adds an integer x into a binary tree T to give a binary tree R.
search returns true if x is contained in the binary tree T.
preorder lists the nodes of the binary tree T using preorder traversal.
inorder lists the nodes of the binary tree T using inorder traversal.
postorder lists the nodes of the binary tree T using postorder traversal.
